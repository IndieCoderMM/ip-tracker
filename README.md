# 🧭 IP Address Tracker

**IP Tracker** is a website that allows users to track the location of an IP address or domain name. This is a solution to the [IP address tracker challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0).

## 📌 Overview

### 🎯 Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## 🚂 My process

### 🧰 Built With

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) - to create UI and dynamic components
- [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) - to visualize geolocation data
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - to manage the state and API calls
- [IP Geolocation API](https://geo.ipify.org/) - to locate IP address
- [ipify API](https://www.ipify.org/) - to get client IP address


### 📝 What I learned

This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of React and Redux and develop many other skills and knowledge in web development.
- I learned how IP address and domain work and how they can be used to locate a website.
- I learned how to use React Leaflet to provide an interactive and intuitive way to view maps.
- I learned how to handle errors effectively in redux thunks and how to improve UX when errors occur.


### 🔭 Future features

- [ ] User Authentication to provide personalized experience
- [ ] Show Remaining Credits for the API
- [ ] Feedback System to get suggestion and bug report
